# GitHub to Markdown Converter


This simple web application allows users to convert GitHub repository file-contents into a single Markdown file/output. It's inspired by the [Copy Text Selected Files](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iyulab.copy-text-selected-files) VS Code extension by iyulab and designed to quickly provide a repo (or parts) as context to a Language Model.
